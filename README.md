#### Project Overview
In our app, the user is placed in a room with a virtual dry erase board that they can write on using the handheld controller. The wall's surface is saved to a file which can be opened and edited later on. This allows users to spread out their work and solve problems without needing a huge amount of space and money for expensive dry erase board installments.

#### Demo Setup
To run our demo, you need an android phone that is compatible with the Google Daydream View. Here are the list of phones that are compatible with the headset: [Headset Ready Phones](https://vr.google.com/daydream/smartphonevr/phones/). You can either download the APK directly from our repository onto your phone, or you can download it onto your computer, hook up your phone via USB cable and drag it into your phone's file directory. Simply tap the app after it is installed, put it in your headset and begin. It is important to note that our app is built specifically for the Daydream View, you will not be able to use the app with other headsets.
